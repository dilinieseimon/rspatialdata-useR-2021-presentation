### Importance of Spatial data analysis `r emo::ji("chart")` 

- With increasing accessibility to geographic information systems (GIS), statisticians and data analysts come across data sets with geo-coded locations. This has generated considerable interest in statistical modeling for location-referenced spatial data. 

- Researchers in diverse disciplines within the physical, social, and environmental sciences and in public health are increasingly faced with the task of analyzing data that are geographically referenced and often presented as maps.

- Disease maps are used to highlight geographic areas with high and low prevalence, incidence, or mortality rates of a specific disease and the variability of such rates over a spatial domain.
